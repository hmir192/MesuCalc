# MesuCalc
This is a python program in which you can find the area and perimeter of elementary 2d and 3d shapes.
This program was written in python 3.9.5 on a 64bit (Debian) linux machine.
I have written this python program after 2 days of learning python.(yeah its that easy)
It involves basic mensurational formulas, basic math, use of operators(conditional and arithmetic).
It is so simple it took me two hours to write and one hour was figuring why the hell python estimates pi to 3.
If you have read all of this text...KUDOS!
